The Orbital team is a group of like minded individuals looking for ways to make development easier, by contributing to the
community and offering helpful development tools.

We noticed that working with an API that isn't finished yet, development can be really delayed. Or,
when testing an application, recreating failure cases that are very specific or uncommon can be difficult.

Having previously worked on various API based projects it was clear we could speed up the process of development by working
against a mocked API that doesn't exist yet. Or better yet, testing edge cases that are difficult to produce under normal circumstances
by mocking them out. How will your application react?


 Orbital is a mocking tool that enables enables rapid _microservice_ development and testing. Orbital supports mocking
 services by using the OpenAPI specification files in both YAML and JSON.
 Orbital allows for parallel development between front-end and back-end teams by reducing the dependency between each other. This reduces idle time and creates a more flexible and dynamic development workspace.
