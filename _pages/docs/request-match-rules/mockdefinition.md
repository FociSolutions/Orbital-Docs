## What is it?

The Mockdefinition is a JSON file that describes any number of endpoints and the scenarios that can be used to meet their criteria. We
create a Mockdefinition using a YAML OpenApi file to start.

The OpenApi file defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for APIs, allowing humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service without source code.

The Mockdefinition is generated by the Orbital Designer. This allows the user to add, update or delete Scenarios.

### Scenarios

The Scenarios describe what the endpoint will expect from the user's HTTP request and the response the user
should expect from the endpoint. A scenario consists of:

- Metadata: A title and description to explain the purpose of the scenario.
- Request Match Rules: These rules will indicate what the users HTTP request has to match to get a response from the server.
- Response: The server's response to the user's HTTP request.

The request match rules include [Header rules](./headersrules), [Query rules](./queryrules), [URL rules](./urlrules) and [Body rules](./bodyrules)
